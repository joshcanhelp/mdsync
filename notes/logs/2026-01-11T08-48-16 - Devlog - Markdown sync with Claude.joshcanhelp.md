I've been really distracted by this project, in a good way. I'm still quite impressed by how far I've gotten with this (I feel funny attributing the progress to me) in about 2.5 hours. The code is understandable and modular, the documentation is passable for now, and I even, actually, much to my surprise, have had fun so far. 

I've learned a lot about how this works fairly quickly and the CHOP guidelines have been very helpful, both for me and [Claude](https://claude.ai). Having something else doing the majority of the construction is, like I've read over and over, forced me to think more clearly about what actually needs to be built. And because I'm not aware of all the lines of code, building step-by-step in a modular way that can be tested is really important. That makes for more clear software (so far) so I can debug it fairly easily.

All in all, I'm impressed and pleased so far. Not what I expected!

Moving on to defining the next epic ...

As usual, making good progress with code but we've hit another snag/bug. The links are not mapping over properly and I'm getting that feeling inside like "uh oh, I don't know this codebase as well as I would if I wrote it." That's fine. Time spent debugging will improve my understanding and, hopefully, will be a fraction of what it takes to write it.
